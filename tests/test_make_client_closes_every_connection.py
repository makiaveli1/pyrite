"""The `make_client` fixture must leave no live SQLite connection behind.

This is the regression guard for the defect a cold read found on the branch
that introduced the fixture: `create_app()` eagerly seeds the KB registry,
which opens a SECOND `PyriteDB` on the same file and parks it on
`application.state.pyrite_db`. Nothing in `pyrite/` ever closes that one, and
some routes read it directly rather than through dependency injection, so a
fixture that closes only the DB it constructed itself leaves an open WAL
connection -- the exact leak the fixture was written to eliminate
(`tests-leak-open-pyritedb-connections-into-temporarydirectory-teardown`).

The leak was invisible on the branch because the fixture also moved to
`tmp_path`, which pytest does not delete during the run. That is a real
mitigation but it is a *default* (`tmp_path_retention_policy`), not a
guarantee: flip the policy and every leaked connection is back to racing
`rmtree`. So this asserts on the connection, not on whether a directory
removal happened to survive.

The check has to run AFTER `make_client`'s teardown, which is why it lives in a
fixture of its own: pytest tears fixtures down in reverse order of setup, so
requesting the probe before `make_client` makes it finalize after it. That
keeps the test self-contained -- an earlier version split it across two tests
and shared a module-level dict, which broke whenever xdist put them on
different workers.
