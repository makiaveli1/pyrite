"""One field-projection rule for every read surface (issue #193).

`?fields=` on the REST routes, `--fields` on the CLI and the MCP `fields`
argument all mean the same thing: return the named fields, always keep the
identity pair, and never invent a key the record does not have. Four spellings
of that rule existed and drifted apart (#179, #192, #134); this is the one
helper they call.

The identity pair is two fields, not four. That matches the MCP contract
`_project_fields` has always implemented, and the REST routes return the
projected payload directly (a `JSONResponse`), so no response model's required
set applies to a projection.
